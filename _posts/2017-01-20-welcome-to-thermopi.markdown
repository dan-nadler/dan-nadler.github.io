Welcome to my Raspberry Pi Thermostat project!

I've been looking for a new project to learn from, and decided to work with the Raspberry Pi. I have a decent programming background, but not much knowledge of the hardware end. I'm going to use this blog to track my progress as I learn the necessary skills to create a thermostat and data collection tool for my house.

My goals for this project are as follows:

1. Create a device capable of recording and save the temperature of at lest 5 rooms.
2. Also consider recording data from the exterior of the building.
3. Save the data and use it to improve my heating efficiency via one-off improvements to things like the thermostat schedule, airflow redirection, etc.
4. Create and connect automated devices that increase my comfort while minimizing energy usage.

These goals aren't set in stone, but I will try to stick to them as I go, and justify any changes to the scope of the project that I do make.
