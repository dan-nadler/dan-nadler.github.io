I just wanted to make a quick post with a better way to do the multi-sensor setup that I am using. Previously, 
I had posted a schematic and pictures where I was using one resistor per sensor. After thinking about this a 
little bit, I realized that this is completely unnecessary, and that you only need one resistor per circuit:
